# Welcome to Somnyx: Your Journey into Understanding Your Dreams

Have you ever woken up from a vivid dream, only to have its details slip away before you could understand its meaning? Or perhaps you've noticed recurring dreams but struggle to piece together their significance in your life? You're not alone—and that's exactly why Somnyx was created.
